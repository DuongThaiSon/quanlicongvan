<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">--4. Favourite Film</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I have ever seen a lot of films but I like &quot;Twenty thousand miles under the sea&quot;. This film is produced by Jules Verne. This film is about the journey around the world of captain Nemo with his friend in 968. At that time, making a submarine is impossible but he made a big one which anyone didn&#039;t knows before. When his boat appeared on the sea, everybody think it was a monster and they tried to destroy it. He had to use his monster to fight with some other boat and many sharks to save themselves. Under the sea, he found a lot of special fish which none has ever seen. When he finished his journey, he shown his boat and everybody look at him admirably. This film is rated with 9 starts and win a valuable prize in oscar. I recommend you watch this film at least once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My favourite sport is badminton(My favourite activity is playing badminton) because of  several reasons. Firstly, it&#039;s an amazing sport. Playing it makes me feel energytic throughout the day. It brings me a lot of energy for a hard-working day. Secondly, it isn&#039;t difficult to play. All of things you need are 2 rackets and a shuttlecock. You have to smash the shuttlecock towards the opponent&#039;s direction. You need a lot of energy to ensure that the shuttlecock crosses over the net. I often play it with my friends in my freetime. The more frequently you play, the healthier you get. In short, I recommend you should play this sport.</p>
